# Death Reborn Update Changelog
## Version info
- Updated on: July 27, 2021
- Version name: 4.1

This update is the minor update to address some of the issue and to apply new version scheme changes.

## Changelog
- Enhanced Audio All in One addon is now back since custom weapon sounds were completely removed in the past update
- We have finally fixed the issue which caused only Jimmy Gibbs to be spawned on Dead Center Finale and it caused these addon to be removed: Corrected Nav, Extended Common Infected
- Removed The Last Stand Weapons Skins (RNG) addon due to graphical glitch for linux users

## Note
We apologize to users who experienced the issue which Jimmy Gibbs bug happened... This was our fault that we did not completely tested before releasing it to public.

We will test them properly before release from now on :)

Also, don't hesitate to give feedback or report any bugs related to Death Reborn modpack, this helps us to address more issue that we missed and give more improvements to our modpack!

Starting from this release, now we will use version name like this: Death Reborn 4.1
Since we cannot post minor update due to current version scheme (Since it is rolling release and it ) so we improved it! Since it doesn't frequently being updated and wanted to have clear update changes between each releases, now we are moving to Point release instead of rolling release! This allows us to have more testing phase before releasing the update and allows modpack to have less bugs compared with old rolling release policy.

Well, that's it! We hope you enjoy the minor updates :)
